# What the hell is **props** and **state** is anyway?
- **props** and **state** are both plain Js _objects_.
- They are just small concepts.
    1. **props** : is short for **properties**. And are a way to pass data from parent to child component.
    - They allow you to pass information down the component tree, making your component more reusalbe and modular.
    - **props** are read-only, meaning that child component can not modify data it receives from it's parent. (**immutable**)
