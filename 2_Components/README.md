# Components

- React Components are Js functions. The only difference is that we declare this in Capital letter. ex: MyButton, MyForm, MyInput etc.















- 1. Functional Components
    - Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. 
    - These are Simply Js Function. These functons may or may not receive data as parameters.
    - In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.
    - Functional components can also  have state which is managed using React hooks.
