# How to start with vite?

- via using **init** command,
```bash 
npm init vite@latest
```
OR
- for installing first time use 
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
- Then it wil ask for project name and framework to use like react, vue, vanilla js etc.
- And you can, choose with the help of arrow keys and enter which one you want to use.
- Then, it will ask for varient to use like typescript, javascript etc.
- Then you have to go to that project folder(previously you named it) from command like,
```bash
cd <project-name>
```

- Here, note that you can directly add project name in command line like
```bash
npm create vite@latest <project-name>
```


- Then, you have to run command,
```bash
npm install
```
    - It will install all the dependencies, list in package.json file.
- Then you can run command, 
```bash
npm run dev
``` 
    - Or either way you can check that package.json file for more options or like what it contains.
